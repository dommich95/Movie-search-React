# Movie Search

## How to start

- clone repository to your local machine
- open in VS code
- Replace API key in Landingpage and in SelectedMovie with yout own API key

  <br/>

## LandingPage

- Shows a list of movies in a horizontal scroll wheel
  -Movies are sorted by popularity
  -on click of a single movie, user will be directed to details page of the movie with a fake play button
  <br/>

## Things which could be improved

1. Adding on a second wheel for " you might be interested in"
2. After user klicked on Movie Detail page and wants to go back he end up on the empty search page again and has to start again
3. Details page could have more details, as: description, how many minutes, and actors
